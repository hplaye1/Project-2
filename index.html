<p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
</p>
<p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>
</div>

<p>Born from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive</p>
<p>The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place</p>
<p>He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead</p>
<p>Come on with it</p>
<p>Mmm, come on</p>

<p>Moments don't pass me up, no, no</p>
<p>'Cause I seize them in stride</p>
<p>Tell them winnin' never gave me in then</p>
<p>And when I eternally have faith</p>
<p>In the choices you made, it's all by design</p>
<p>Go with it, mmmm</p>
<p>Come on, don't fuck up the Feng shui</p>
<p>Feng shui, Feng shui, Feng shui</p>

<p>I see every thing with new beams, I do dream</p>
<p>My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring</p>
<p>Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think</p>
<p>When you think too much you're removing what's moving (oh)</p>
<p>Stuck inside a statue, look at you (oh)</p>
<p>Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (oh)</p>
<p>A petty logo, shed all my tattoos</p>
<p>I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful</p>
