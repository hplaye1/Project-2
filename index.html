  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
  </p>
  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>


  <p>Born from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive</p>
  <p>The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place</p>
  <p>He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead</p>
  <p>Come on with it</p>
  <p>Mmm, come on</p>


  <p>Moments don't pass me up, no, no</p>
  <p>'Cause I seize them in stride</p>
  <p>Tell them winnin' never gave me in then</p>
  <p>And when I eternally have faith</p>
  <p>In the choices you made, it's all by design</p>
  <p>Go with it, mmmm</p>
  <p>Come on, don't fuck up the Feng shui</p>
  <p>Feng shui, Feng shui, Feng shui</p>

  <p>I see every thing with new beams, I do dream</p>
  <p>My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring</p>
  <p>Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think</p>
  <p>When you think too much you're removing what's moving (oh)</p>
  <p>Stuck inside a statue, look at you (oh)</p>
  <p>Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (oh)</p>
  <p>A petty logo, shed all my tattoos</p>
  <p>I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful</p>

  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>
  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>

  <p>The universe never steered me wrong, the universe never lied</p>
  <p>Take me bound to the come me down, the fantasy in this remedy</p>
  <p>Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time</p>
  <p>New levels</p>
  <p>Mmm, come on</p>

  <p>Moments don't pass me up, no, no</p>
  <p>'Cause I seize them in stride</p>
  <p>Tell them winnin' never gave me in then</p>
  <p>And when I eternally have faith</p>
  <p>And the choices you made, it's all by design</p>
  <p>Go with it, mmmm</p>
  <p>Come on, don't fuck up the Feng shui</p>

  <p>So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah</p>
  <p>I savor your love</p>
  <p>Don't fuck up the Feng shui</p>

  <p>I see every thing with new beams, I do dream</p>
  <p>My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring</p>
  <p>Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think</p>
  <p>When you think too much you're removing what's moving (oh)</p>
  <p>Stuck inside a statue, look at you (oh)</p>
  <p>Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (oh)</p>
  <p>A petty logo, shed all my tattoos</p>
  <p>I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful</p>

  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light (mhm)</p>
  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light (mhm)</p>

  <p>Feel I'm being tested every minute</p>
  <p>Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost</p>
  <p>Seems I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence</p>
  <p>Truly in my essence, I've arrived</p>

  <p>Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me</p>
  <p>Too alive, too alive, new arriving</p>
  <p>You were right, I was left in it before</p>
  <p>To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne</p>
  <p>Parallel to paradise, I reach out for my lifeline</p>
  <p>The angels laugh in paradise, they say I am my own lifeline</p>
  <p>Look in you</p>
  <p>To the night, to the night I'm abandoned</p>
  <p>To deny, to deny, what a sandpit</p>
  <p>Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?</p>
  <p>To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne</p>

  <p>So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah</p>
  <p>I savor your love</p>
  <p>Don't fuck up the Feng shui</p>

  <p>I see every thing with new beams, I do dream</p>
  <p>My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring</p>
  <p>Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think</p>
  <p>When you think too much you're removing what's moving (oh)</p>
  <p>Stuck inside a statue, look at you (oh)</p>
  <p>Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (oh)</p>
  <p>A petty logo, shed all my tattoos</p>
  <p>A petty logo, shed all my tattoos</p>

  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>
  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>
  <p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>
