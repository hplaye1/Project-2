<h1>By Design</h1>

<p>Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
  Born from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive
  The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place
  He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
  Come on with it
  Mmm, come on
  Moments don't pass me up, no, no
  'Cause I seize them in stride
  Tell them winnin' never gave me in then
  And when I eternally have faith
  In the choices you made, it's all by design
  Go with it, mmmm
  Come on, don't fuck up the Feng shui
  Feng shui, Feng shui, Feng shui
  I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
  My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
  Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
  When you think too much you're removing what's moving (oh)
  Stuck inside a statue, look at you (oh)
  Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (oh)
  A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
  I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
  The universe never steered me wrong, the universe never lied
  Take me bound to the come me down, the fantasy in this remedy
  Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
  New levels
  Mmm, come on
  Moments don't pass me up, no, no
  'Cause I seize them in stride
  Tell them winnin' never gave me in then
  And when I eternally have faith
  And the choices you made, it's all by design
  Go with it, mmmm
  Come on, don't fuck up the Feng shui
  So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
  I savor your love
  Don't fuck up the Feng shui
  I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
  My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
  Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
  When you think too much you're removing what's moving (oh)
  Stuck inside a statue, look at you (oh)
  Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (oh)
  A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
  I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light (mhm)
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light (mhm, mh-mh)
  Feel I'm being tested every minute
  Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
  Seems I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
  Truly in my essence, I've arrived
  Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
  Too alive, too alive, new arriving
  You were right, I was left in it before
  To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
  Parallel to paradise, I reach out for my lifeline
  The angels laugh in paradise, they say I am my own lifeline
  Look in you
  To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
  To deny, to deny, what a sandpit
  Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
  To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
  So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
  I savor your love
  Don't fuck up the Feng shui
  I see every thing with new beams, I do dream
  My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
  Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
  When you think too much you're removing what's moving (oh)
  Stuck inside a statue, look at you (oh)
  Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (oh)
  A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
  I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light
  Ooh, tap in to the frequency, light</p>
